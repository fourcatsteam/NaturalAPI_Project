## What is NaturalAPI?
**NaturalAPI** is a toolkit able to automatically generate application programming interfaces (APIs) and related unit tests for a given programming language, starting from features and scenarios in Gherkin format and from text documents related to the domain of interest.


The project is created by the **FourCats** team for the _**Software Engineering**_ exam of the *Degree Course in Computer Science of the University of Padua*.

## To begin with:
#### To use the product you must have installed on your system the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) included in JRE (Java Runtime Environment) downloadable at the following link: [JRE](https://www.java.com/it/download/).
#### In particular, NaturalAPI is composed of three distinct modules: NaturalAPI Discover, NaturalAPI Design, NaturalAPI Develop. Each module is independent of the others, so you can only run one module at a time.
### To download and use a module:
1. Go to [NaturalAPI](https://fourcatsteam.github.io/NaturalAPI_Project/) website;
2. Click on the button of the module you want to download; 
> *If you prefer you can also download the CLI version of the product at the bottom of the webpage*
3. Each module have differents needs:
   * NaturalAPI Discover: needs in input a series of text file in .txt; 
   * NaturalAPI Design: needs in input .feature files in Gherkin format and also can receive in input a BDL generated by the module Discover;
   * NaturalAPI Develop: needs in input a valid BAL, the output of the module Design in JSON format, and PLA in txt format; 
4. To start the execution of the selected module follow the instructions in the User manual supplied with the product: the user can start the program via Command Line Interface (CLI) or Graphic User Interface (GUI).

_**N.B. The format of the files needed by the modules can be found in the [User manual v.1.0.0](https://github.com/fourcatsteam/NaturalAPI_Project/blob/master/Documentation/English/UserManual%20v1.0.0.pdf).**_
