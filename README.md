## What is NaturalAPI?
**NaturalAPI** is a toolkit able to automatically generate application programming interfaces (APIs) and related unit tests for a given programming language, starting from features and scenarios in Gherkin format and from text documents related to the domain of interest.


The project is created by the **FourCats** team** for the _**Software Engineering**_ exam of the *Degree Course in Computer Science of the University of Padua*.
> *More information can be found by consulting the documentation that will be made public when the project is delivered.
